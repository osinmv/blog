## Idea

The idea came to me when **twitch** banned **Pog** emotes. I decided to develop a super casual game about catching **Pog** emotes for android phones. 

## Development

The development was not hard due to the fact that I already developed some game demos on unity as pet projects.  Everything started with me creating a screen with falling emotes and score at the top.

The second stage was to add start screen of the game. Since all the start screens are similar among all phone games I decided to create an asset  that generates start screen for me. This is an example of it in my game.

Finally I had to add simple screens for win and lose conditions. Here how it looks in my game

## Conclusion

I am happy with what I have achieved in 1 week of development. The game certainly has its style. The game is fully finished. You may check it out in google play.

**P.s** I will give an update when it will be released in google play
