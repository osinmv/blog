## Introduction

Long Canadian days brought me to a realization that I should work. I could not find a job, thus I decided to help some [ _open source_ ](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Open_source) community. After a small search, I found a project that needed my help.
This was [Momentum Mod](https://github.com/momentum-mod) community.

## Community

This community is special. Firstly, it was a community dedicated to develop a standalone game. Secondly, the community had all types of jobs to do. Thirdly, they gave keys to closed beta test of the game once you contributed into it.

## Documentation

I should mention that I do not have any experience with **C++**. Thus, the only thing that I could contribute was **documentation**. Here is how it [currently looks][https://docs.momentum-mod.org/entity/mapbase_enhancements/]. At the time I chatted with **Gocnak**. He is a maintainer of [game][https://github.com/momentum-mod/game] and [documentation][https://github.com/momentum-mod/docs] repositories on **GitHub**. Gocnak told me that there is some lack of documentation for game entities. This is the exact thing I wrote documentation for.

## Testing and Jekyll

Once I finished writing documentation, I had to test and check that all the posts. Since the documentation website uses **Jekyll** to create the website, I had to test it on **Jekyll**  myself. It took me about 1 hour to figure out how **Jekyll** works. After that, I tested the pages I created and everything was fine. 

## Conclusion

I completed documentation in one week. In that same week I learned Jekyll, got into closed beta and made my [first pull request][https://github.com/momentum-mod/docs/pull/59]. I think that this was a success for a first year student in UTSC.
